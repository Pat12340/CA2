Contact tracing web app
PROJECT AIM & SCOPE
An effective way of responding to a pandemic, such as COVID, is knowing who you have been recently in contact with and being able to inform them that they may have it if you contract the virus.

Being able to quickly recall who you have been in contact with allows for rapid self-isolation response times, preventing the spread of the virus/disease.

Our application provides a convenient way to keep a track of those you have recently come in contact with. 
Users can log who they have met, for how long they have met and if they maintained social distancing.
Users can then view this data as they need it.

It contains a:
